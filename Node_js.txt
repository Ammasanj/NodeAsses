Node :
	CMD: utility used to type the commands to computer rather than clicking
        Arguments: value that gives to the program that affect thow it runs
	Machine code: computer understandable language spoken by microprocessor[microprocessor -->Machine lanuage..> Assembly language..>c,c++
        
        V8 nodejs engine written in c++, it convert javascrits to machine code
	ECMASCRIPT: standerd for javascript
	javascript engine: c++ program that convert javscript to computer processor can understand
	
	Server and client architcture
	First class functions : use functions like other types strings,number
	inheritance: one object access properties and  methods of another object
	Function Constructors: Normal function used to create the object,the "this" keyword points to the newly created object and new object returned automaticaly by the function
	Primitive Datatype: Type of data that represent single value(number,string)
	scope: where in code you have access to a particular variable or function 

	Reveling module pattern: Exposing the only methods and properties you want via returned objects.A clean and common way of protect and structure the code with in module.
	Mutate : To change something[ex: adding a method or properties to an object
	Variable Typing: Assign a number to a variable and then the same variable can be assigned to a string

	Events: System events: c++ core: libuv: A file is open, received data from internet..:closer to the lower level
		custom Events: javascriptcore : Event Emitter
		
		Event listener: piece of code(function ) that responds to an event

When we use new operator,
1)create a this object
2)point to current object
2)return the object without using the explicit 'return'

Factory function
constructor function
object literals
Every object has a constructor property that referes the functon that used to create the object

Primitive datatypes are copiying the values where as Arrays, Object and Functions are copiying the reference(memory address)


For enumarating the keys in an object....>
for in, 
get all the keys in an object....>
Object.keys
to check whether a key exists in an Object...>
'key' in 'Object'



Abstraction: hide the details and exposeonly essentials


Instance member vs prototypical member:
hasOwnProperty,Object.keys return Instance member;
for in iterate over prototypical member

Object.assign...>used to copy one object to another

NPM is a tool that used to install the 3rd party libraries and tools.
